### DTEG

This pipeline integrates RNA-seq and Ribo-seq to calculate translation efficiency as the number of ribosomes per gene, normalized to transcript abundance. Genes with significant changes in translation efficiency between conditions are considered to undergo translational regulation and are labelled Differential Translation Efficiency Genes (DTEGs).

See the original [publication](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31763789/) and GitHub [repository](https://github.com/SGDDNB/translational_regulation) for more information.

To run this pipeline, you will need to have NextFlow and Singularity installed (already available on Biowulf and FRCE).

For more questions about this wrapper of the DTEG pipeline, you may contact [Colin Wu](mailto:colin.wu2@nih.gov) or [Wilfried Guiblet](mailto:guibletwm@nih.gov).
